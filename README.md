Gaussian plume model.  
The Prairie Grass experiment was an experiment conducted in a grass field in Nebraska, USA in 
July-August 1956. A release took place from a point source close to ground level (46 cm height). 
SO2 was used as a tracer, and concentrations were measured on arcs at distances of 50 m, 100 m, 
200 m, 400 m and 800 m. The duration of each of the 68 sampling periods was 10 minutes. 
Sampling was along a semicircle from west (270 degrees) to north to east (90 degrees), with the 
release due south of the north point of the sampling array. The Prairie Grass dataset has been 
extensively used to evaluate the performance of atmospheric dispersion models and source 
inversion techniques under different stability conditions.  
The purpose of the study is to model the Prairie Grass experiment using the Gaussian Plume Model 
and evaluate how close the model is to the experiment.
